== Build Configuration

You can find the {product-name} libraries in the Maven Central repository.

Simply add the following dependency to your maven project

[source,xml,subs=attributes+,title="Maven [pom.xml]"]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>software.xdev</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-data-eclipse-store</artifactId>
       <version>{maven-version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Also see the https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/releases/latest#Installation[installation guide for the latest release].

== Configuration

After adding the library in your dependencies, using it is as easy as adding the ``@EnableEclipseStoreRepositories`` annotation to your ``@SpringBootApplication`` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Since the library is using reflection to copy data, the following JVM-Arguments may have to be set.

[source,title="JVM Arguments"]
----
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.time=ALL-UNNAMED

== Demo

To see how easy it is to implement EclipseStore in your Spring project, take a look at the three https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/tree/develop/spring-data-eclipse-store-demo[demos]:
A https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/tree/develop/spring-data-eclipse-store-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/spring/data/eclipse/store/demo/simple[simple], a more https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/tree/develop/spring-data-eclipse-store-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/spring/data/eclipse/store/demo/complex[complex demo] and a https://github.com/xdev-software/spring-data-eclipse-store/tree/develop/spring-data-eclipse-store-jpa/src/main/java/software/xdev/spring/data/eclipse/store/jpa[demo with coexisting JPA].

== Drop in compatible [[drop-in-compatible]]

After adding the dependency and the annotation you are ready to go.
This makes this library drop in compatible for Spring-Data projects.
